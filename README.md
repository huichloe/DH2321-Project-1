# This tool is designed to help users find their ideal groupmates. An ideal group would be well-rounded by having members with complementary skills,
# with similar average scores to limit disparity inskill and expectations, which facilitates fair contribution.
# The user starts by sorting potential groupmates by descending level of a user-defined skill (math skills, artistic skills etc.) using the interactive
# data frame (Fig. 1) to find members with desired complementary skills. The box plot (Fig. 2) gives an overview of the range and disparities of each
# skill for the userâ€™s reference. The user can also compare the desired skill level of potential groupmates to their respective average score using the
# interactive scatter plot (Fig. 3). Drop-down menus are utilised to sort by skill.
# Then, the user can further compare the qualitative data (major, hobbies etc.) of up to five potential groupmates by selecting their alias in the
# drop-down menu (Fig. 4) to see if their interests align.
